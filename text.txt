TfL journey planner layout improvements
portfolio project by Roberta Silva

Design review
The current journey planner page of Transport for London website has all the results beneath the fold on both mobile and desktop.
My assumption is that it is difficult for users to discover the available travel options.

Wireframing
I’ve mocked up a variant where I have merged duplicate Journey Results heading within the breadcrumb menu.
I've also moved Travel and Accessibility Options control next to Edit button – hence making space for a journey result.

A/B Testing
To validate my design hypothesis I've I’ll be carrying out A/B testing to see which variant performs better.
I've set up a test using remote usability testing platform, asking a target audience which version of the results page will help them make decision on which route to take quicker.

Design process
I've adopted this process to have a solid foundation for my work as a designer within different organisations. 
I’m following the same flow when I’m walking through my case studies in this portfolio.
